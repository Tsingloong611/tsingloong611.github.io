## **Breaking the Chains: Whitelisting the Essential Tool for High-Speed Cloud Downloads in Microsoft Edge**

### Introduction

For many users, downloading files from major cloud services—particularly when dealing with platforms like **Baidu Netdisk (百度网盘)**—is often hampered by restrictive speed limits. To achieve the high-speed file transfers needed, tools that extract direct download links for use with dedicated download managers (like IDM or Aria2) are indispensable.

One such powerful UserScript tool is the **Pan Linker Download Assistant (网盘直链下载助手)**, version 6.2.7. However, installing or enabling this tool on Microsoft Edge is often blocked by default security settings, resulting in the alert: **"This extension is not from any known source, and may have been added without your knowledge."**

This guide documents the practical, administrative steps required to bypass this security block using the Windows Local Group Policy Editor, allowing this crucial utility to function without hindrance.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you must have the required Microsoft Edge policy templates installed on your system to access the correct settings in GPEDIT.

*   *Reference for ADMX/ADML Templates:* [Microsoft Edge Enterprise Download Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download)
*   **Target Extension ID:** `kigpaofgibailejenmmebodcpdgbmdgf`

### Step 1: Identify the Extension ID

The unique identifier for the blocked extension is required for whitelisting. As seen on the `edge://extensions/` page:

*   **Extension Name:** Pan Linker Download Assistant 6.2.7
*   **Blocked ID:** `kigpaofgibailejenmmebodcpdgbmdgf`

### Step 2: Navigate to Edge Policy Settings in GPEDIT

Open the Local Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`). The relevant configuration path is (You need to install ADMX/ADML Templates first):

> **Computer Configuration**
> ↳ **Administrative Templates**
> ↳ **Classic Administrative Templates(ADM)**
> ↳ **Microsoft Edge**
> ↳ **Extensions**

### Step 3: Configure the Allow List Policy

We will utilize the **"Allow specific extensions to be installed"** policy. This acts as a security override, exempting the specified Extension ID from any active blocklist policies that restrict external installation.

#### Configuration Steps:

1.  Double-click **"Allow specific extensions to be installed."**
2.  Set the policy status to **"Enabled."**
3.  Click the **"Show Contents"** button under "Options."
4.  In the "Extension IDs to exempt from the block list" dialog, enter the ID of the download assistant:
    *   **Value:** `kigpaofgibailejenmmebodcpdgbmdgf`

5.  Confirm the changes by clicking **OK** on both policy windows.

### Step 4: Apply and Verify Policy Changes

For immediate application of the new policy, use the command line:

1.  Open Command Prompt as an **Administrator**.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    gpupdate /force
    ```
3.  Close and reopen Microsoft Edge.

### Conclusion

Upon restart, navigate to `edge://extensions/`. The red security warning is now dismissed, and the **Pan Linker Download Assistant** (v6.2.7)—a tool essential for high-speed transfers from platforms like Baidu Netdisk—is fully enabled and functional.

This practice demonstrates the effective use of the `ExtensionInstallAllowlist` policy to manage and secure third-party, non-store extensions, ensuring that essential utilities can operate even in strictly managed browser environments.
